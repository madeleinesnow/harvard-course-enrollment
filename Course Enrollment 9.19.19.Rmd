```{r, include=FALSE}

x <- read_excel("./class_enrollment_summary_by_term_9.19.19.xlsx", skip = 3) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(course_department == "English") %>% 
  arrange(desc(total)) %>% 
  select(course_department, course_name, total) %>% 
  head(1)

```

The English class with the highest enrollment is `r x`.
